CSE 421: Project 1
README
Group: Dean Steuer, Kai Hsu, Mitch Taylor 


Directory should contain four files
(1) This README document which explains directory documents
(2) myhttpd.c - the source code of the program. This program sets up a server and receives
    requests for data from clients
(3) Makefile - contains commands for compiling and running  myhttpd.c
(4) DESIGN.txt - a design documents detailing the data structure used in the code,
    context switch locations, how it avoids race conditions, a brief critique of the
    design of the program, and online and offline resources used to help design
    and build the program
    
The directory also contains 3 html files that clients can requests from the server. Clients can request
a file by first connecting to the active server port and submit a request in the form Get/Head [html_file_name].
After the queuing time has expired the server will send a response with the requested message to the
client.

Running the program:
    Once compiled, the program can run like a UNIX command

    ./myhttpd [-d][-h][-l][-p][-r][-t][-n][-s]

    -d       :Set up debug mode and print results to the console. If this
             flag is not specified it will run as a daemon process
    -h       :print a usage message to the console
    -l file  :this flag will log all outputs to the specified file
             following this flag
    -p port  :Specify the port number to listen on. If not specified, port is 8080
             by default
    -r dir   :Set the root directory for the server to dir
    -t time  :Set queue time to time seconds. Default is 60 seconds
    -n threadnum :set number of threads waiting ready in execution thread pool to threadnum
                  Default is 4 threads
    -s sched :Set scheduling policy, either First Come First Serve or Shortest Job First
              FCFS by default
